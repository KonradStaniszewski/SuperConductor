# Super Conductor Simulation
This is a visual representation of the quantum phase states of the cooper bair bonding present within a typeI super conductor.
I learned all the physics present within this simulation while there. 
This particular simulation uses the XY monte carlo random sampling method to get a running time that is reasonable on a modern pc. Running a perfet simulation of a type I superconductor without this statistical approximation would require the computing strength of a super computer. For this reason the monte carlo random sampling algorith is a very  powerfull tool as it allows semi accurate approximations that can help develop an intuition for what is occuring physicaly.
This would not have been possible to make without the incredible mentorship given to me at the ISSYP summer camp. 

### Runnning Instructions:
1. Ensure that python3 is installed
2. Ensure that matplotlib is installed
3. make sure that numpy is installed
4. run the python file with python3
