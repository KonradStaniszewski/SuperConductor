# Super Conductor Simulation
This is a xy model simulation of a SuperConductor

This is done using monte carlo random sampling and is a very effective way to
visualize the cooper pair bonding present within a type I superconductor.

Runnning Instructions:
1. Ensure that python3 is installed
2. Ensure that matplotlib is installed
3. make sure that numpy is installed
4. run the python file with python3
